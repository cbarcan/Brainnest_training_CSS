          <h2>Straw Hat Pirates Recruitment Process</h2>
          <p>
            In the beginning of the manga, Luffy claimed that he wanted at least ten people to join his crew before entering
            the Grand Line (not counting himself). Though most adventures in One Piece are random, there seems to be a ‘process’
            for recruitment: This process also led many fans to think Vivi would become a […] More

          <h2>Lucky Roo’s Hidden Power</h2>
          <p>
            Many people have come to speculate over what Lucky Roo’s Devil Fruit is. A majority of these speculations often
            revolve around how Lucky easily shot a bandit in Foosha Village. These speculations also say that it was because
            of Lucky Roo that Shanks got to Marineford so quickly and that Lucky’s power is a time/teleportation/speed […] More

          <h2>Manga Covers suggest the importance of the connection between Shanks and Blackbeard!</h2>
          <p>
            Shanks and Teach have, as of volume 96, appeared on five volume covers each. They also happen to be the same five
            volumes: 25, 45, 59, 95, and 96. So Shanks and Teach have always appeared together on the five volume covers they’re
            each featured in. One has never appeared on a cover without the other, and I doubt that’s […] More
